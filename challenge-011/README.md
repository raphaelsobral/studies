## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I feel like it is a dillema because I learned I know way less than I thought I did. I had some challenges over basic things I thought I managed well but in the end I guess it looks as close as possible.

### Continued development

I guess I need to go over the basics of background-image all over again.

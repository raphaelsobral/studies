## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have started using css variables and started using the aria-hidden property. I think I got the hang of flexbox since I have been able to use it without getting lost like I used to do.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on accessibility and try to develop faster.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Beside all the flexbox and adjusting the font, margin and padding sizes which is making me undrstand more about pixels, em and all the stuff, I am also having a lot of fun understanding more about the harmony of colors and fonts a page.

### Continued development

I want to keep studying flexbox and mobile-first workflow along with media queries. I also want to star using variables for the fonts and colors.

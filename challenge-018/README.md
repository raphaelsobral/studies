## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

This challenge helped on my process of getting my JavaScript skills sharper and and I learned about making elements not visible but still perceptible for screen readers.

### Continued development

 I'm still in the process of learning and improving my JS skills, so I want to continue creating more and more projects using it. I also want to delve deeper into accessibility.

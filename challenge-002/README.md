## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I could use a table and put to test what I had learned previously about datas, rows and etc. I also had the opportunity to get to know a little better about media queries which is a subject I have been studying lately.

### Continued development

As mentioned previously, I have experimented with media queries in this challenge and I find it fascinating each time I learn something new and I am excited to keep working with it.

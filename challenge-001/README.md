## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As a newbie, even the smallest progress is important and makes me feel proud of my achievements. This might be a simple and easy project but putting my knowlegde to test while I learn new things is very exciting. 

### Continued development

I just started using flexbox and I plan on working on many more projects that will help me learn even more about it.

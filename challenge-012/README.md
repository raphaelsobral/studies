## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since the mobile version is so different from the desktop one, I had to learn how to personalize it using margins, paddings and so.


### Continued development

I want to keep using flex and start leaning about css grid and javascript.
